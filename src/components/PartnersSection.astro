    Mama Cash shared power with hundreds of grantee partners globally
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-16 max-w-[75ch] text-sm">
    In 40 years, we put more than €91 million in the hands of individuals,
    groups, and movements who organised on their own, and pushed for lasting
    change. Our biggest learnings in four decades, come from our grantee
    partners.
