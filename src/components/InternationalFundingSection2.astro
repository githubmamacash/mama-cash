    text: "At a time when many feminists were wary of wealth's corrupting influence, Mama Cash played a pivotal role in reshaping attitudes towards money and power. By providing loan guarantees, building peer networks for women with inherited wealth, and fostering a culture of individual feminist giving, Mama Cash strengthened women's financial expertise and independence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mama Cashâ€™s loan guarantees led to the launch of 140 women-led businesses, influencing the Dutch banking sector to see women entrepreneurs as viable investments.",
